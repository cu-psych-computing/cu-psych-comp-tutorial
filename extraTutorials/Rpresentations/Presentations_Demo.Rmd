# Why should I make my presentation in R?

* No more copying and pasting graphs into powerpoint or keynote.

* Great for data presentations and lab meetings where you need to show lots of graphs.

* Great for tutorials or labs where you want to show code and output.

* Maybe don't use this when you really really care about how your slides are laid out.

***

# Arranging your text

1.  Hashtags can be used to add headers of various sizes

2.  Start lines with numerals for a numbered list, or use (*) for unnumbered lines

3.  End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph.  

> Block quotes start with (>)

* See code for how to do:
+  *italics* 
+ **bold**
+ superscripts^2^
+ ~~strikethrough~~

# Adding images

```{r, out.height = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Evie.jpg")
```

> - In the code header: {r, out.width="400px", fig.align="center"}
