    "- SciPy: Provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra and statistics.\n",

    "#### Data Visualization\n",
    "- Matplotlib: Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures. The pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface and is what most people use.\n",
    "- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
