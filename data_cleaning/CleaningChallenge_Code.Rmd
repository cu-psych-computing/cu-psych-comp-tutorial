## Goals of this challenge

Students will test their understanding of:
1. How to open data in R
2. How to check for missing or problematic data and address issues.
3. How to rearrange and shape data in preparation for analysis. 

## Your turn!

Now it's your turn to try opening and cleaning a new data set. There are issues with the raw data, so make sure to inspect the variables and make changes when needed. Below is a rough outline you can follow, in the end, you should have a file in the long format with XX rows and XX columns.

```{r}

# Read the data into R. The file is called "Study2_Subjects.csv". Check out the separate "README_Study2.txt" file for information on the study and variables.

getwd()

subjects <- read.csv("Study2_Subjects.csv")


# View the first 5 rows of the data frame


# Examine the data for issues. Some things to look for: are the column names logical? Are there missing values? Do the variable types make sense? (ie does everything that's a factor make sense as a factor, and does everything that's numeric make sense as numeric?) Are there values that don't make sense? Fix any issues you find.


# This study has three conditions, based on how long the subject kept their hand in cold water. Right now this is categorical, but you may want to look at it continuously. Make a new condition variable that's numeric.


# Each subject in this study filled out three related questionnaires, but these scores can be combined into a composite score but taking the sum. Create a new variable for this score.


# You see there's another .csv file for Study 2, this one's called Study2_Trials.csv. Open it and take a look. This frame has the same 10 subjects, but now it has reaction time data from a task with 30 trials. Create a new data frame that combines this with your subject level information. Hint: ?merge, by="ID"


# Now that you have a one frame with all the data, put it into long format. Each subject should have one row for each trial.


# You want to do a separate analysis only on the people who had a high score on the anxiety questionnaire. Create a new data frame with just the individuals who got 50 or higher. (Hint, check out ?subset for help)



# You should have 4 data frames now (subject level, trial level, combined, and the subset). Save them as a new .rda file for future use
