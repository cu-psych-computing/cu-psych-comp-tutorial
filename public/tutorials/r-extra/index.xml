      <description>Links to Files The files for all tutorials can be downloaded from the Columbia Psychology Scientific Computing GitHub page using these instructions. This particular file is located here: /content/tutorials/r-extra/data-sim-power/basic-simulation-power.rmd.
Why Simulate? Simulation is an extremely useful tool, because we can create ground truth by which to test our models. If we know the true process by which the data are generated, we can check whether our models are doing well at recovering this truth.</description>
