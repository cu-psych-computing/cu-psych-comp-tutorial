A few quick points: Among scientific computing languages the best language for you is the one that you find best fits your projects We really encourage the use of either R and Python for research computing for several reasons R and Python are open source!</description>

      <description>Disclaimer! This intro programming tutorial in Python is NOT nearly as comprehensive as the intro programming tutorial in R. If you have never programmed in any language before, this tutorial may skip key pieces of information. Instead, the goal of this tutorial is to provide some key pieces of &amp;rsquo;translation&amp;rsquo; information for people with some programming experience who would like to use Python. Goals of this Lesson Students will: Understand and be comfortable working with the basic data types in Python Be able to use arithmetic, relational operators, and lists in Python For those coming from R, be aware of differences across languages, especially in indexing Links to Files and Video Recording The files for all tutorials can be downloaded from the Columbia Psychology Scientific Computing GitHub page using these instructions.</description>

Indenting in python Python, unlike R, is strict about indentation! Indentations in python often have bearing on the order in which they are executed, and switching indentation can change how code runs (or break it) Coming from R, indentation might seem annoying at first, but eventually this can help with code readability Ultimately, python is trying to help us stay organized If statements If statements in python are the equivalent of the following English: &amp;ldquo;If condition X is met, then do action Y&amp;rdquo; If statements in python consist of the following syntax if (condition X): actions.</description>
