# Welcome!

## Individual Scientific Computing Support

---

Columbia University psychology graduate students can stop by to chat about using computing tools at any stage of the research process. Use cases include, but are not limited to:

- Conducting pre-study power analysis
- Setting up tools for administering tasks in-person and online
- Cleaning and analyzing data
- Preparing presentations and manuscripts

During the 2022-2023 school year, the [graduate methods support advisors](/who) will be holding office hours by appointment. To schedule a time that works well for you, or for email support, please contact [psych-methods-support@columbia.edu](mailto:psych-methods-support@columbia.edu){target="_blank"}.

## Ongoing Meetings and Workshops

---

The Introductory Scientific Computing Workshop will take place on Friday, September 30th, 2022. Check <a href="/workshop">the workshop page</a> for more information.

Keep an eye on the [Meetings](/meetings) page for upcoming workshops and events throughout the school year.

## Annual Introductory Scientific Computing Workshop
